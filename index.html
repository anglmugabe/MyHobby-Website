            Gardening is the process of growing plants for their vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, and appearances
            within a
            designated space. Gardens fulfill a wide assortment of purposes, notably the production of aesthetically
            pleasing
            areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes, foods, poisons, wildlife habitats, and saleable goods. People
            often partake in gardening for its therapeutic, health, educational, cultural, philosophical, environmental,
            and
            religious benefits
